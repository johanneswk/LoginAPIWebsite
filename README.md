# LoginWebsiteAPI
Welcome to my first Github Project! Here you can read more about this project

## Why did you make it?
This was a school project where I combined a Java Servlet webpage with a Json API.
We had to rebuild an existing website from the ground up. Due to copyright concerns all the images and videos of that certain website are removed. Now I use images that are in the public domain. And that's why they aren't so nice to look at. 

## What does it do?
You need to enter a ticketnumber, flightnumber, email and a password. 
It will use the flight API of Schiphol to get the appropriate flight information of the flightnumber you entered.

## How to use it?
You will need to get acces to the Schiphol API:
```
www.schiphol.nl/en/developer-center/page/our-flight-api-explored/
```

After that you can import this github page into your own IDE.
Then you change the 'id' and 'key' in the ServletLogin java file to the ones provided by the Schiphol API.
