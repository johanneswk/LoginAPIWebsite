# LoginWebsiteAPI
Welcome to my first Github Project! Here you can read more about this project

## Why did you make it?
This was a school project where I combined a Java Servlet webpage with a Json API.
We had to rebuild an existing website from the ground up. Due to copyright concerns all the images and videos of that certain website are removed. Now I use images that are in the public domain. And that's why the pictures aren't so nice to look at and some hyperlinks are removed. 

## What does it do?
You need to enter a ticketnumber, flightnumber, email and a password. 
It will use the flight API of Schiphol to get the appropriate flight information of the flightnumber you entered.

## How to use it?
You will need to get acces to the Schiphol API:
```
www.schiphol.nl/en/developer-center/page/our-flight-api-explored/
```

After that you can import this github page into your own IDE.
Then you change the 'id' and 'key' in the ServletLogin java file to the ones provided by the Schiphol API.

You need to use Tomcat in order to run it on your local host to view the web page. 
```
http://tomcat.apache.org
```

## I can't read the comments in the Java, HTML or CSS? 
The code it written together with Dutch comments. I hope to change this someday in the future.
